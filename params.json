I wrote this module because all other Python implementations I knew did\r\nnot support efficient online updates.\r\n\r\nThe feature list:\r\n\r\n* [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org) compatible interface.\r\n* Efficient online updates.\r\n* Prediction of first order derivatives.\r\n* Estimation of the log likelihood and its derivative.\r\n* Well documented.\r\n* [Good test coverage.](https://coveralls.io/r/jgosmann/goppy>)\r\n* Supports Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, and 3.3. Later versions are likely to work as well.\r\n* MIT license.\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThe documentation can be found at http://goppy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nYou can install GopPy with pip:\r\n\r\n    pip install goppy\r\n\r\nOr you [download the latest source distribution from PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/GopPy/), extract it and run:\r\n\r\n    python setup.py install\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
